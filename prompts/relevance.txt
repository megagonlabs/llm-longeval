# Instruction:
Below is an instruction for evaluating the relevance of the generated summary to the source article. Relevance measures whether a summary contains the main ideas of the source. The goal is to score relevance on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being not relevant at all, and 5 being highly relevant.

# Evaluation Criteria:
1. Not Relevant: The summary doesnâ€™t capture any of the main ideas of the source.
2. Barely Relevant: The summary captures very few of the main ideas of the source.
3. Somewhat Relevant: The summary captures some, but not all, of the main ideas of the source.
4. Mostly Relevant: The summary captures most of the main ideas of the source.
5. Highly Relevant: The summary captures all the main ideas of the source perfectly.

# Evaluation Steps:
1. Thoroughly read the source article.
2. Carefully read the generated summary and compare it with the source article.
3. Compare the main ideas captured in the summary to the main ideas from the source article.
4. Rate the relevance of the summary based on how well it captures the main ideas from the source article using the 1-5 scale mentioned in Evaluation Criteria.
