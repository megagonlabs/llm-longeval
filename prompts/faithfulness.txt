# Instruction:
Below is an instruction for evaluating the faithfulness of the generated summary to the source article. Faithfulness is the absence of factual errors in the summary, where a factual error is a statement that contradicts the source article or is not directly stated, heavily implied, or logically entailed by the source article. The goal is to score faithfulness on a scale of 1-7, with 1 being unfaithful (all information is wrong) and 7 being extremely faithful (no factual errors, directly correlate to the article).

# Evaluation Criteria:
1. Unfaithful: The summary contains no factual information from the article.
2. Mostly Unfaithful: The summary contains very few factual information from the article.
3. Somewhat Unfaithful: The summary contains some factual information but several are wrong or misleading.
4. Neutral: The summary is half correct and half incorrect in terms of factual information.
5. Somewhat Faithful: The summary contains more factual information than errors but still has noticeable mistakes.
6. Mostly Faithful: The summary contains almost all factual information from the article with minor mistakes.
7. Extremely Faithful: The summary contains all factual information from the article with no errors.


# Evaluation Steps:
1. Thoroughly read the source article.
2. Carefully read the generated summary and compare it with the source article.
3. Carefully read the summary and compare the facts presented with the facts in the source article.
4. Rate the faithfulness of the generated summary based on how faithfully the summary reflects the information in the source article using the 1-7 scale mentioned in Evaluation Criteria.
