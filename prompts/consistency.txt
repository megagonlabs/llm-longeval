# Instruction:
Below is an instruction for evaluating the consistency of the generated summary to the source article. Consistency measures whether a candidate summary is factually consistent with the source. The goal is to score consistency on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being completely inconsistent and 5 being completely consistent.

Please consider the following seven types of errors while performing the evaluation: i) predicate in summary inconsistent with source, ii) primary arguments or its attributes are wrong, iii) predicateâ€™s circumstantial information is wrong, iv) co-reference error, v) multiple sentences linked incorrectly, vi) out of article error and vii) unreadable sentence(s) due to grammatical errors.

# Evaluation Criteria:
1. Completely Inconsistent - The summary contains multiple factual errors or inaccuracies in relation to the source article.
2. Mostly Inconsistent - The summary contains several factual errors but retains some accurate information from the source.
3. Somewhat Consistent - The summary contains a mix of accurate and inaccurate information. Factual errors are present but not overwhelming.
4. Mostly Consistent - The summary is largely accurate, with few factual errors or inaccuracies.
5. Completely Consistent - The summary accurately represents all the information presented in the source article without any factual error.

# Evaluation Steps:
1. Thoroughly read the source article.
2. Carefully read the generated summary and compare it with the source article.
3. Rate the consistency of the generated summary based on the provided types of errors using the 1-5 scale mentioned in Evaluation Criteria.
